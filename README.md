# TilePainter
## Just small program, that was created because proper tile drawing software was absent

Wanted to create a game, need of my own graphics, did not find any good piece of software, that let you preview your
tile, while you were painting it.

## Features:
- Automatically updating preview, based on current drawing
- Ability to save your creation (to a downloads folder, for now)
- Ability to change size of your tiles (limited from 8 to 64)
- Ability to change scaling of pixels (1 to 15)
